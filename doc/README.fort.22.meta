When the ASGS Workflow creates a fort.22 file, it is difficult to tell how that
file has been modified from the original, just by looking at it. The Workflow
(specifically, storm_track_gen.pl) is capable of generating variations in
track, overland speed, and maximum wind speed. Modifications to radius to max
wind will be provided for in a future ASGS release (beyond v1.2).  

In order to clearly indicate whether the track has been varied, and if so, how
the track has been varied, two metadata mechanisms are provided. First, a file
with a fixed name, fort.22.meta, is created that contains a description of the
wind file. In addition, a symbolic link is made to the fort.22 file that
contains encoded information about the data in the file. These mechanisms will
now be described in turn.

The fort.22.meta file uses the '#' symbol to denote comments, so lines starting
with # are ignored. The other lines are key value pairs using the delimiter
':'. Everything on one line before the first delimiter is considered to be the
key, everything after that until the end of the line (not including the
linebreak) is the value. 

The order of the key/value pairs is arbitrary, and the names of the keys are
subject to extension and/or change. In order to manage any changes, and make it
future-safe, a version specification in the first line is a requirement. This
would make it possible to read in the files after changes in the format/key
names easily later.

An example of a fort.22.meta file is as follows:

# Example fort.22 meta file
version:1
year:2008
storm:07
advisory:01
hostname:tezpur.hpc.lsu.edu
directory advisory:/work/jgflemin/072008/01
directory storm:/work/jgflemin/072008/01/nowcast
modified:y
variation veer:+40

The shorthand mechanism for fort.22 metadata consists of a symbolic link to
the fort.22 file. The name of the link encodes the track variations according
to the following format:

YYYYSSAA[c|m]_w[+|-]PPo[+|-]PPv[+|-]PPPr[+|-]PP

where 
YYYY is the four digit year
SS is the number of that storm for that year
AA is the advisory number
c means consensus or m means modified
w[+|-]PP is the 2 digit, positive or negative percent variation in max
wind speed
o[+|-]PP is the 2 digit, positive or negative percent variation in over
land speed
v[+|-]PPP is the 3 digit, positive or negative percent variation in veer
r[+|-]PP is the 2 digit, positive or negative percent variation in rmax
(not supported by storm_track_gen.pl as of ASGS v1.2).

As a concrete example of the above format that provides the same track
information as the fort.22.meta file described above:

20080701m_w+00o+00v+040r+00

This symbolic link can be found by looking for a filename that follows this
format; there will not be another file in the directory whose name matches
this format.
