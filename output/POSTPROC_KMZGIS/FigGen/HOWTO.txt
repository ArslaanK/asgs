You should be able to untar this in your directory and then link the 3 files
(fort.14, fort.22, maxele.63) and then run ./generate_images_lpfs_wideview.pl
and get a nice plot out of it.

How to run the modified Casey's plotting program.

The program has been modified to plot the track line and 
position by running an external script which reads the fort.22 file.

The plotting packlage is run by a script that first reads the fort.22 file.

From that file, two track files are created one for plotting the track line,
and the other for plotting the positions.

The cycle time is also read from the fort.22 file.
The script modifes this time and converts to Central Standard or Daylight time.
The cycle time is part of the title of the plot.

Also in the title of the plot is the advisory number and the run type.
This information is read form hte one line file named
"./track_name_file"
This file MUST be updated before every run  
(until we find a way to have this info read from somewhere else)

Next the bounds for the plot are set.
currently these are
                 $Wlon = "-92.0" ;
                 $Elon = "-88.0" ;
                 $Slat = "28.5"  ;
                 $Nlat = "31.0"  ;

In my mind it is easier to change the script than the input file.  
Eventually these bounds can be created "on the fly"

The script modified ts the FG_lpfs.inp.orig file and creates a new file called
FG_lpfs.inp Which is in turn read by the program.

The maxele.63 file must be there and the fort.14 file
We also need a color palette, Default31.pal 

The last thing the script does is run the FigureGen26_wline.exe program.

with these files in the working directory, we are set to go.
just run trhe script generate_images_lpfs_wideview.pl.   


I am learning easier ways to modify files in perl and 
hope to clean up the process in the future.
