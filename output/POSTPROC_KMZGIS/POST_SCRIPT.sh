# This script will run the KMZ and GIS shapefile generator
# 
#
# to use copy this script where you would like the output to be generated,
# follow the instructions on how to set up the path definitions and 
# variable definitions in this file and in the Renci config file
# and be sure the grid you are using is properly placed in the grid folder 
# and fully decomposed so that it can be used by the GMT functions.
# 
# if your grid has not already been decomposed, you must do this first!
# there is a program in the grids folder ./grd2gmt.x
# here is an example of how to run it for our purposes:
#  ./grd2gmt.x sl15v3_2007_r10.grd sl15v3_2007_r10
# this will produce 4 files named 
# sl15v3_2007_r10.gmt.bnd.xy
# sl15v3_2007_r10.gmt.tri
# sl15v3_2007_r10.gmt.xy
# sl15v3_2007_r10.gmt.xyz
# 
# now you are ready to continue
#
# First set path to the POSTPROC_KMZGIS directory
#

POSTPROC_DIR=$OUTPUTDIR/POSTPROC_KMZGIS

# add location of KMZ scripts to PATH 
# This should be fine unless locations were really changed

export PPDIR=$POSTPROC_DIR/RenciGETools-1.0/src

# now set dddefinitions needed for the KMZ generator
#
# .. KMZ .. 

# THERE ARE 2 FILES TO EDIT PRIOR TO RUNNING KMZ SCRIPTS

# .......
# 1 must edit $PPDIR/config_simple_gmt_pp.sh
# .......

# This is the main configuration file for the KMZ scripts.
# in this file you must indicate the computer on which you
# are trying to run, AND the bounding box for your output.
# the vairable names are :
#
# TARGET and BOX
#
# For TARGET, be sure to double check the paths to the indicated software packages.
# These are all required so if they do not currently exist, you will need to install them.
# 
# If you do not see your computer or the region of your interest,
# then simply add a case using the existing cases as a template.

# .........
# 2 now modify this script
# .........


# now declare the variables to input into script
#
# This is the meat of what needs to be defined.
# 
# INPUTFILE : need to identify location of input data file
# GRIDPREFIX : need to identify which grid set will be used
# OUTPUTPREFIX : set output filename prefix
# NUMLAYER : number of layers to the KMZ file for street level resolution we recommend 4 layers
# On topsail.unc.edu 4 layers for a 270000 node grid took 14 minutes.
# to test the script use only 1 layer.

# #####################################################
#
# now set definitions for GIS generator
#
# .. GIS ..
# 
# For the GIS shapefiles we need the full poath name of the grid that your are running
# and we will use the same file as above for the input file 
# (you of course can change this as you desire)
# The program name for the script is actoshape

# excecute config file to get bounds for output box (full coastline)
# and location (Path) to grid files
